# Technology Choices and Rationale

## Core Technologies

### PyTorch + HuggingFace Transformers

**Choice**: PyTorch with Transformers library

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for deep learning research and production
- Extensive model zoo (BERT, GPT, RoBERTa, etc.)
- Easy transition from research to production
- Strong community support and documentation
- Native distributed training support

**Trade-offs**:
- More memory intensive than TensorFlow for some models
- Requires explicit GPU management

### Celery + Redis

**Choice**: Celery for distributed task queue, Redis as broker

**Rationale**:
- Mature, battle-tested technology (10+ years)
- Python-native, easy integration
- Supports priorities, retries, and rate limiting
- Horizontal scaling via multiple workers
- Rich monitoring and debugging tools

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **RabbitMQ**: More complex setup, overkill for this use case
- **Apache Kafka**: Better for streaming, not task queues
- **AWS SQS**: Vendor lock-in, higher latency

**Trade-offs**:
- Single point of failure if Redis not clustered
- Requires separate Redis installation

### Ray

**Choice**: Ray for distributed computing

**Rationale**:
- Built specifically for ML workloads
- Fault-tolerant distributed execution
- Easy integration with PyTorch
- Automatic GPU discovery across nodes
- Low overhead for small tasks

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Dask**: Better for data processing, not ML training
- **Horovod**: Focuses on distributed training only
- **Spark**: Too heavy for our use case

### Prometheus

**Choice**: Prometheus for metrics collection

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for metrics and monitoring
- Pull-based model (no SDK required in code)
- Rich query language (PromQL)
- Extensive ecosystem (Grafana, AlertManager)
- Time-series database optimized for metrics



### Job Prioritization Algorithm

**Choice**: Weighted Fair Queuing with Priority Levels

**Rationale**:
- Balances priority with fairness
- Prevents starvation via automatic priority boosting
- Per-user quotas prevent monopolization
- Simple to understand and debug

**Key Features**:
1. Three priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
2. Automatic priority boost after starvation timeout
3. Fair share accounting via GPU-hours
4. Preemption support for low-priority jobs

### Resource Pool Design

**Choice**: Separate Development and Production Pools

**Rationale**:
- Development pools allow fast iteration (small GPUs)
- Production pools for full-scale training
- Isolation prevents dev jobs from blocking prod
- Different SLAs and quotas per pool

**Configuration**:
- Development: 2 GPUs, preemptible, 1-hour max
- Production: 8+ GPUs, non-preemptible, 48-hour max

### Checkpoint Strategy

**Choice**: Periodic checkpointing with best model tracking

**Rationale**:
- Resume capability after failures
- Save best model for deployment
- Limit storage via max_checkpoints
- Configurable save frequency

**Storage**: Local filesystem (extensible to S3/GCS)


### 100+ Concurrent Users

**Horizontal Scaling**:
1. Multiple Celery workers across nodes
2. Redis Cluster for distributed queue
3. Ray for multi-node distributed training
4. Shared storage (NFS/S3) for checkpoints

**Vertical Scaling**:
1. Multi-GPU nodes (8x A100/V100)
2. DataParallel for single-node multi-GPU
3. Mixed precision training (2x memory)
4. Gradient checkpointing (memory efficiency)

**Load Management**:
1. Per-user quotas (max GPUs, max jobs)
2. Queue depth limits
3. Job timeout enforcement
4. Automatic retry with backoff

## Cost-Effectiveness

### Cloud Resource Optimization

1. **Spot Instances**: 70% cost savings (future)
2. **Auto-scaling**: Scale workers with demand
3. **GPU Pooling**: Maximize utilization
4. **Mixed Precision**: Reduce memory, fit bigger models


## Monitoring Philosophy

**Principle**: Observability over Debugging

**Approach**:
1. **Metrics**: Prometheus for time-series data
2. **Logs**: Structured JSON logs for analysis
3. **Traces**: (Future) Distributed tracing for jobs
4. **Alerts**: Prometheus AlertManager integration

**What We Monitor**:
- GPU utilization and health
- Queue depth and wait times
- Job success/failure rates
- Training metrics (loss, accuracy)
- Resource allocation


### Kubernetes Integration

**Benefits**:
- Better orchestration and auto-scaling
- Service discovery
- Rolling updates
- Resource quotas

**Challenges**:
- Complexity overhead
- GPU support still maturing
- Learning curve
